Figure 1.1: Administrator
Figure 1.1 depicts the homepage or index of the Arellano University Subject Advancing System (AUSAS). Upon logging in as an ADMINISTRATOR, it grants overall access across the database and the system. Consequently, the homepage displays six (6) buttons, enabling the user to access Accounts Management, where all the accounts saved in the database are located; Students Management, where all the registered students are recorded; Subjects Management, where the subject description and pre-requisites are displayed; Grades Management, where the student‚Äôs information and their list of grades are found; Advising Management, where the student's information and list of subjects are located; and a button that displays the username, which the user can access to change their password.

Figure 1.2: Registrar/Staff
Figure 1.2 depicts the homepage or index of the Arellano University Subject Advancing System (AUSAS).

Figure 1.3: Student
Figure 1.3 shows the homepage or index of the Arellano University Subject Advancing System (AUSAS).
